		On October 13, 2014 the NewScientist published an article titled Automatic authors: Making machines that tell tales that talks about a new artificial intelligence project arguing that soon we will not be the only ones who make up stories.  AI is taking storytelling to a new path. An European group is working on a project called the What-if Machine also known as the WHIM, which “will generate, assess, select and present fictional ideas within a variety of linguistic construction, such as short stories, poems, neologisms, tweets, jokes, plot lines, and dialogues” according to the team.   To know more about this project visit http://www.whim-project.eu/.
